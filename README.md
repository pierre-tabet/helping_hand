Motor learning difficulties affect children’s ability to develop fine motor skills such as handwriting, which has a great effect on their academic performance. Occupational therapy and robot-assisted learning are useful in helping develop these skills and minimise the impact of these disorders.
A handwriting robotic platform was developed aimed at measuring current handwriting capabilities in children and assist in learning through a haptic feedback planar 2-degree of freedom (DoF) robotic arm. Through a structured design approach, an intuitive end-effector guide was developed, to replicate normal handwriting ergonomics. The system can assess the child’s handwriting capabilities through optical character recognition, based on which a series of tasks are generated with an engaging and interactive user interface.
Validation of the platform showed promising results but shortcomings in developing full haptic feedback capabilities for the system impaired full assessment of its performance. A novel solution has been introduced to inform future work and development.
