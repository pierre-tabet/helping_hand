Motor learning difficulties affect children’s ability to develop fine motor skills such as handwriting, which has a great effect on their academic performance. Occupational therapy and robot-assisted learning are useful in helping develop these skills and minimise the impact of these disorders.
A handwriting robotic platform was developed aimed at measuring current handwriting capabilities in children and assist in learning through a haptic feedback planar 2-degree of freedom (DoF) robotic arm. Through a structured design approach, an intuitive end-effector guide was developed, to replicate normal handwriting ergonomics. The system can assess the child’s handwriting capabilities through optical character recognition, based on which a series of tasks are generated with an engaging and interactive user interface.

As the lead software engineer, I created a CNN using fastai and pytorch to assess handwriting abilities. By utilising Dynamic difficulty adjustments (DDAs), the system was able to adapt the difficulty of the exercises provided in real time  This ensures a child will not feel frustrated or bored whilst providing them with a challenging enough experience to keep them engaged until the end of the exercises. Traditional handwriting exercise books increase in difficulty in a stepwise manner. This often leads to a negative experience as the child will attempt to map a “ pre-decided learning curve”. In order to provide a DDA experience and increase the time spent exercising it was decided to incorporate a tablet computer into the project. Tablets are increasingly being recommended by doctors for handwriting practice because they encourage independence, a key part of therapy.
